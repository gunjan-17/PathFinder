# Pathfinder

## Description

Pathfinder is a pathfinding visualizer that finds the path between a source node and a target node using various pathfinding algorithms.

## Features

- **Multiple Pathfinding Algorithms**: Select between four pathfinding algorithms:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* (A star) Algorithm
- **Maze Generation**:
  - Create a maze of walls using recursive division, ensuring the maze is always solvable.
  - Generate a randomized weighted maze by selecting the density of the weights.
